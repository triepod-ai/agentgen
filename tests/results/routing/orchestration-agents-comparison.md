# Orchestration Agents Comparison

## Overview

We now have three distinct orchestration agents with clear separation of concerns:

| Agent | Complexity | Focus | Coordination Scope |
|-------|------------|-------|------------------- |
| `@orchestrate-agents` | Green/Yellow | Simple agent selection | 1-3 agents, basic patterns |
| `@orchestrate-agents-adv` | Red | Enterprise coordination | 4+ agents, complex workflows |
| `@orchestrate-tasks` | All | Task breakdown | Task planning, not agent coordination |

## Agent Details

### ðŸŸ¡ `@orchestrate-agents` (Standard)
**Model**: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022  
**Complexity**: Yellow (Sonnet)  
**Purpose**: Standard agent orchestrator for Green/Yellow complexity tasks

**Capabilities**:
- Single-agent recommendations
- Simple 2-3 agent coordination (Sequential/Parallel)
- Green task utility agent selection
- Yellow task development specialist selection
- **Automatic escalation** to advanced version for Red complexity

**Coordination Patterns**:
- Single Agent (preferred)
- Sequential (Agent A â†’ Agent B â†’ Agent C)
- Parallel (Agent A + Agent B independent)
- Handoff (Agent A completes â†’ Agent B takes over)

**Escalation Triggers**:
- 4+ agents needed
- Multi-phase workflows
- Enterprise-scale projects
- Complex architectural decisions
- Multi-domain coordination
- System-wide changes

### ðŸ”´ `@orchestrate-agents-adv` (Advanced)
**Model**: claude-3-opus-20240229  
**Complexity**: Red (Opus)  
**Purpose**: Enterprise multi-agent orchestration for complex workflows

**Capabilities**:
- Sophisticated multi-agent coordination (4+ agents)
- Enterprise-scale workflow orchestration
- Multi-phase project coordination
- Cross-domain integration
- Quality gates and validation
- Competitive solution evaluation
- Hierarchical coordination patterns

**Orchestration Patterns**:
- Hierarchical (Supervisor coordinating teams)
- Wave (Multi-stage with validation gates)
- Competitive (Multiple approaches evaluated)
- Pipeline (Sequential with handoffs)
- Parallel (Independent team coordination)

### ðŸ”§ `@orchestrate-tasks` (Task Planning)
**Model**: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022  
**Complexity**: Yellow (Sonnet)  
**Purpose**: Task breakdown and workflow planning

**Capabilities**:
- Complex task decomposition
- Dependency mapping
- Timeline planning
- TodoWrite integration
- Multi-session project management

**Task Patterns**:
- Sequential (Task A â†’ Task B â†’ Task C)
- Parallel (Independent tasks)
- Pipeline (Output feeds input)
- Batch (Group similar tasks)
- Conditional (Based on results)

## Test Results Comparison

### Standard Orchestrator Test
**Scenario**: React code review and bug fixing  
**Response**: âœ… Correctly recommended single agent (`@code-reviewer`) with supporting agents  
**Pattern**: Simple coordination (max 3 agents)  
**Behavior**: Appropriate for Yellow complexity

### Advanced Orchestrator Tests
**Scenarios**: Security audit, WebSocket evaluation, E-commerce platform  
**Response**: âœ… Sophisticated multi-agent coordination  
**Patterns**: Hierarchical, Competitive, Wave orchestration  
**Behavior**: Enterprise-grade planning and coordination

### Escalation Test
**Scenario**: 13-agent, 3-phase workflow with dependencies  
**Standard Response**: âœ… Correctly escalated to `@orchestrate-agents-adv`  
**Advanced Response**: âœ… Comprehensive workflow orchestration  
**Behavior**: Proper recognition of complexity boundaries

## Usage Guidelines

### Use `@orchestrate-agents` (Standard) When:
- âœ… Simple agent selection needed
- âœ… 1-3 agents maximum
- âœ… Green/Yellow complexity tasks
- âœ… Straightforward workflows
- âœ… Quick recommendations needed

**Examples**:
- "Review this code" â†’ `@code-reviewer`
- "Debug this error" â†’ `@debugger`
- "Analyze logs and fix issues" â†’ `@log-reader` + `@debugger`

### Use `@orchestrate-agents-adv` (Advanced) When:
- âœ… 4+ agents needed
- âœ… Multi-phase projects
- âœ… Enterprise-scale coordination
- âœ… Complex inter-dependencies
- âœ… Multiple solution evaluation needed

**Examples**:
- Security audits across entire systems
- Architecture design for scalable platforms
- Comprehensive modernization projects
- Multi-domain integration projects

### Use `@orchestrate-tasks` When:
- âœ… Complex task breakdown needed
- âœ… Project planning and timeline creation
- âœ… Multi-session workflow management
- âœ… Dependency mapping required

**Examples**:
- "Break down this feature into manageable tasks"
- "Plan the migration project timeline"
- "Create a roadmap for system improvements"

## Performance Characteristics

| Aspect | Standard | Advanced | Tasks |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Response Time** | Fast | Moderate | Fast |
| **Token Usage** | Low | High | Moderate |
| **Coordination Depth** | Basic | Sophisticated | Planning-focused |
| **Agent Discovery** | Limited | Comprehensive | Not applicable |
| **Quality Gates** | Basic | Advanced | Planning stage |
| **Scalability** | 1-3 agents | 4+ agents | Task-focused |

## Integration Patterns

### Standard â†’ Advanced Escalation
```
User Request â†’ @orchestrate-agents â†’ Complexity Analysis â†’ 
If Red complexity: "Use @orchestrate-agents-adv for sophisticated coordination"
```

### Advanced â†’ Tasks Integration
```
@orchestrate-agents-adv â†’ Multi-phase planning â†’ 
@orchestrate-tasks for detailed task breakdown within phases
```

### Tasks â†’ Agents Integration  
```
@orchestrate-tasks â†’ Task breakdown â†’ 
@orchestrate-agents for agent selection per task
```

## Conclusion

The three-tier orchestration system provides:

1. **Efficient Triage**: Standard orchestrator handles 80% of simple coordination needs
2. **Enterprise Capability**: Advanced orchestrator manages complex multi-agent workflows
3. **Planning Support**: Task orchestrator provides project planning and breakdown
4. **Automatic Escalation**: Intelligent routing between orchestrators based on complexity
5. **Clear Separation**: Each orchestrator has distinct purpose and capabilities

This architecture ensures optimal resource usage while maintaining sophisticated coordination capabilities for enterprise-scale software development.
