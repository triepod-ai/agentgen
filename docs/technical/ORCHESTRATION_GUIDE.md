# Orchestration Quick Reference Guide

## üéØ Primary Entry Point: @orchestrate-tasks

**Use `@orchestrate-tasks` as your primary orchestration entry point for all complex operations.**

```bash
# Primary orchestration (RECOMMENDED)
@orchestrate-tasks "Review code quality and implement security improvements"
@orchestrate-tasks "Build complete authentication system with testing"
@orchestrate-tasks "Modernize legacy system with performance optimization"
```

## üß† Context-Manager Integration (OPERATIONAL)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

All orchestration agents automatically integrate with the context-manager:
- **Automatic project understanding** - no need to re-explain project structure
- **Cross-agent coordination** - shared context across all operations
- **Informed decision-making** - all routing based on current project state
- **Activity tracking** - real-time monitoring of multi-agent operations

## üèóÔ∏è Orchestration Hierarchy

### 1. @orchestrate-tasks (Sonnet 3.7/Yellow) ‚≠ê PRIMARY
- **Intelligence layer** with automatic context-manager integration
- **Complexity analysis** and intelligent routing
- **Task breakdown** and dependency mapping
- **Routes to appropriate orchestrator** based on complexity

### 2. @orchestrate-agents (Sonnet 4/Orange)
- **Standard coordination** for 1-3 agents
- **Simple workflows** and straightforward tasks
- **Context-aware** agent selection

### 3. @orchestrate-agents-adv (Opus/Red)
- **Enterprise coordination** for 4+ agents
- **Complex multi-phase workflows**
- **Full context integration** for sophisticated operations

## üìã Usage Patterns

### When to Use @orchestrate-tasks
- **Always start here** for complex, multi-step operations
- When you need **intelligent routing** to the right orchestrator
- For **task breakdown** and planning assistance
- When you want **automatic context integration**

### Direct Orchestrator Usage
```bash
# Simple coordination (1-3 agents)
@orchestrate-agents "review code and fix bugs"

# Complex coordination (4+ agents, enterprise)
@orchestrate-agents-adv "comprehensive security audit with modernization"
```

### Single Agent Usage
```bash
# When you know exactly which agent you need
@code-reviewer "analyze this specific file"
@debug-issue "investigate this error message"
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- **No redundant questions** - agents understand project automatically
- **Intelligent routing** - right orchestrator for the right complexity
- **Cost optimization** - appropriate model selection for task complexity
- **Seamless coordination** - shared context across all operations
- **Activity tracking** - monitor progress across multi-agent workflows
- **Proven reliability** - 100% test success rate with comprehensive validation
- **Systematic debugging** - robust testing methodology for future maintenance

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start with @orchestrate-tasks** for any complex operation
2. **Let the intelligence layer** analyze and route your request
3. **Trust the automatic context integration** - no need to re-explain project details
4. **Monitor progress** through the integrated activity tracking

**Example Workflow**:
```bash
@orchestrate-tasks "I need to improve the security and performance of our authentication system"

# The system will:
# 1. Query context-manager for project understanding
# 2. Analyze complexity (likely Red - enterprise level)
# 3. Route to @orchestrate-agents-adv
# 4. Coordinate security-auditor, performance-engineer, architect-specialist
# 5. Track progress and coordinate handoffs
```

## üß™ Testing & Validation

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETE**

### Test Suite Results
- **@orchestrate-tasks Testing**: 100% pass rate (25/25 test scenarios)
- **Systematic Debugging**: Root cause analysis with complete resolution
- **Keyword Scoring System**: Advanced pattern matching replacing brittle logic
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive validation framework for future maintenance

### Testing Methodology
- **25 Test Scenarios**: Covering all complexity levels and routing decisions
