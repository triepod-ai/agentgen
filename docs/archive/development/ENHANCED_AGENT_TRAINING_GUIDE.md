## 💡 Advanced Usage Patterns

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

#### **Coordinated Security and Development Review**
```bash
# Complex Workflow: Security + React Analysis
@orchestrate-tasks "Comprehensive application review:
1. Security audit with OWASP compliance
2. React component optimization analysis  
3. Cross-cutting security concerns in frontend
4. Performance impact of security measures
5. Integrated remediation plan"

# Expected orchestration flow:
# Step 1: @security-auditor-enhanced performs security audit
# Step 2: @react-specialist-enhanced analyzes frontend
# Step 3: @architect-specialist reviews integration
# Step 4: @orchestrate-tasks synthesizes recommendations
```

**Advanced Orchestration Output:**
```yaml
Integrated Analysis Results:
  Security-Performance Trade-offs:
    - HTTPS overhead: 2ms latency impact (acceptable)
    - JWT validation: 0.5ms per request (optimizable)
    - Input sanitization: Minimal performance impact
    
  Frontend Security Integration:
    - CSP headers: Properly implemented
    - XSS prevention: React default protection + sanitization
    - CSRF tokens: Integrated with React forms
    
  Optimization Recommendations:
    - Security: Implement rate limiting with Redis cache
    - Performance: Use Web Workers for crypto operations
    - Integration: Server-side validation with client-side feedback
    
  Implementation Plan:
    Phase 1 (Week 1): Critical security fixes
    Phase 2 (Week 2): Performance optimizations  
    Phase 3 (Week 3): Integration testing and validation
```

#### **Enterprise Architecture Review**
```bash
# Enterprise-Scale Analysis
@orchestrate-tasks "Enterprise architecture review:
1. Security posture assessment across all services
2. React application scalability analysis
3. Infrastructure security compliance
4. Performance benchmarking and optimization
5. Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation plan"
```

### Context-Aware Enhancement

#### **Project-Specific Optimization**
```bash
# Enhanced agents automatically understand project context
@security-auditor-enhanced "Review current authentication system" 
# (Automatically detects: Express.js, JWT tokens, MongoDB, specific versions)

@react-specialist-enhanced "Optimize component performance"
# (Automatically detects: Next.js 13, TypeScript, React 18, specific dependencies)
```

#### **Historical Context Integration**
```bash
# Enhanced agents remember previous interactions
@security-auditor-enhanced "Update security review based on previous recommendations"
# (References previous audit, tracks implemented changes, focuses on remaining issues)

@react-specialist-enhanced "Continue performance optimization from last session"
# (Continues from previous analysis, tracks progress, suggests next steps)
```

- Infrastructure security validation
$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD)" 

# Capture results for pipeline decision
SECURITY_SCORE=$(grep "Overall Security Score" /tmp/security-audit.log | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' ')

if (( $(echo "$SECURITY_SCORE < 8.0" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "❌ Security score $SECURITY_SCORE below threshold (8.0) - Failing build"
    exit 1
else

echo "📊 Performance Impact Summary:"
echo "  Bundle Size: $BUNDLE_SIZE_IMPACT"
echo "  Render Time: $RENDER_TIME_IMPACT"

# Performance gate checks
if [[ $BUNDLE_SIZE_IMPACT =~ "+[0-9]+%" ]] && [[ ${BUNDLE_SIZE_IMPACT//[^0-9]/} -gt 10 ]]; then
    echo "❌ Bundle size increased by ${BUNDLE_SIZE_IMPACT} - Review required"

## 📊 Performance Optimization Techniques

### Response Time Optimization

#### **Query Optimization Strategies**
```yaml
Technique 1: Specific Context Provision
  Inefficient:
    @security-auditor-enhanced "Review my application security"
    
  Optimized:
    @security-auditor-enhanced "OWASP Top 10 compliance review for:
    - Express.js v4.18 REST API
    - JWT authentication with refresh tokens
    - MongoDB v6.0 with Mongoose ODM
    - Input validation with Joi schema
    - Rate limiting with express-rate-limit"
    
  Performance Gain: 40% faster response (specific patterns retrieved)

Technique 2: Progressive Query Refinement
  Initial Query:
    @react-specialist-enhanced "Component performance issues"
    
  Refined Query:
    @react-specialist-enhanced "React 18 performance optimization for:
    - Large list rendering (10,000+ items)
    - Complex state updates with useReducer
    - Frequent re-renders in nested components
    - Memory leaks in useEffect cleanup"
    
  Performance Gain: 60% more accurate results, faster implementation

Technique 3: Context Accumulation
  Session Start:
    @security-auditor-enhanced "Initial security audit for new project"
    
  Follow-up Queries:
    @security-auditor-enhanced "Focus on authentication vulnerabilities"
    @security-auditor-enhanced "Review API security based on previous findings"
    
  Performance Gain: Each query builds on previous context, faster and more relevant
```

#### **Caching Optimization**
```yaml
Cache-Friendly Query Patterns:

Pattern 1: Consistent Terminology
  Use: "OWASP compliance review"
  Avoid: "security check using OWASP guidelines"
  Benefit: Higher cache hit rates for similar queries

Pattern 2: Structured Requests
  Template: "@[agent] '[action] for [technology] [version] [specific focus]'"
  Example: "@react-specialist-enhanced 'Performance optimization for React 18.2 with Next.js 13.4'"
  Benefit: Predictable patterns enable intelligent caching

Pattern 3: Incremental Queries
  Start: General analysis
  Refine: Specific focus areas
  Benefit: Cached patterns accelerate subsequent queries
```
