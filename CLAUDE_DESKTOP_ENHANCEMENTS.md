```

#### Phase 4: Agent Enhancement
```yaml
Enhancement Process:
1. Base Agent Analysis → Identify enhancement opportunities

### Creating Custom Enhanced Agents

#### Step 1: Domain Analysis
```bash
# Identify enhancement opportunity
1. Analyze current agent capabilities
2. Define domain expertise gaps  
3. Research authoritative sources
4. Plan pattern extraction strategy
```

#### Step 2: Knowledge Extraction
