```

**Responsibilities**:
- Parse ambiguous user requests
- Research codebase context and existing patterns

**Input**: Raw, unclear, or research-heavy user requests
**Output**: Clean, detailed requirements ready for orchestration

### Layer 2: `@orchestrate-tasks` (Intelligence & Routing)
```yaml
Purpose: Complexity analysis and intelligent routing
Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022  
Color: blue
Tools: [Task, Read, Write, Bash, TodoWrite, LS, Grep, Glob]
Complexity: Yellow (analysis and routing)
Cost: Low (Sonnet)
```

**Responsibilities**:
- Assess task complexity (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Break down complex requests into manageable tasks
- Route to appropriate orchestration layer
- Create TodoWrite tracking lists
- Handle pure task-planning requests

**Input**: Clean requirements (from general-request or direct)
**Output**: Route to orchestrate-agents OR orchestrate-agents-adv

### Layer 3a: `@orchestrate-agents` (Simple Coordination)
```yaml
Purpose: Standard agent selection and basic coordination
Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
Color: blue
Tools: [LS, Read, Grep]
Complexity: Yellow (standard coordination)
Cost: Low (Sonnet)
```

**Scope**: 1-3 agents, single domain, straightforward workflows
**Escalation**: Routes to orchestrate-agents-adv for complex scenarios

### Layer 3b: `@orchestrate-agents-adv` (Complex Coordination)
```yaml
Purpose: Enterprise-scale multi-agent coordination
Model: claude-3-opus-20240229
Color: red  
Tools: [Task, Read, Write, Bash, TodoWrite, LS, Grep, Glob]
Complexity: Red (sophisticated reasoning)
Cost: High (Opus) - Only when complexity justifies it
```

**Scope**: 4+ agents, multi-phase workflows, enterprise-scale projects

## 🔄 Usage Flow Examples

### Example 1: Unclear Request (Full Hierarchy)
```bash
User: "My app is slow and users are complaining"

# Step 1: Research & Clarification
@general-request "My app is slow and users are complaining"
# → Investigates codebase, identifies bottlenecks, clarifies requirements
# → Output: "Performance optimization needed: database queries (N+1), 
#   large bundle size (2MB), no caching. React app with Node.js backend."

# Step 2: Complexity Analysis & Routing  
@orchestrate-tasks "Performance optimization: database N+1 queries, 
bundle size reduction from 2MB, implement caching. React + Node.js stack."
# → Assesses: Multiple domains (frontend + backend + infrastructure)
# → Routes to: @orchestrate-agents-adv (complex multi-domain)

# Step 3: Complex Coordination
@orchestrate-agents-adv [detailed performance requirements]
# → Multi-phase workflow with performance specialists
```

### Example 2: Clear Simple Request (Skip Research)
```bash
User: "Review my React component for bugs"

# Direct to Step 2: Analysis & Routing
@orchestrate-tasks "Review React component for bugs"  
# → Assesses: Single domain, 1-2 agents needed
# → Routes to: @orchestrate-agents (simple coordination)

# Step 3: Simple Coordination  
@orchestrate-agents "Review React component for bugs"
# → Recommends: @code-reviewer + @react-pro
```

### Example 3: Clear Complex Request (Skip Research)
```bash
User: "Design microservices architecture for e-commerce platform"

# Direct to Step 2: Analysis & Routing
@orchestrate-tasks "Design microservices architecture for e-commerce platform"
# → Assesses: Enterprise-scale, multi-domain, 6+ agents needed
# → Routes to: @orchestrate-agents-adv (complex coordination)

# Step 3: Complex Coordination
@orchestrate-agents-adv [e-commerce architecture requirements]
# → Multi-phase enterprise coordination
```

## 🎯 Decision Matrix: When to Use Each Layer

### Start with `@general-request` when:
- ✅ Request is vague or ambiguous
- ✅ Unfamiliar domain or technology
- ✅ Need to understand existing codebase context
- ✅ Multiple possible approaches to evaluate
- ✅ Research-intensive requirements

### Start with `@orchestrate-tasks` when:
- ✅ Requirements are clear and specific
- ✅ You know what needs to be done
- ✅ Want complexity analysis and routing
- ✅ Need task breakdown and planning

### Direct to `@orchestrate-agents` when:
- ✅ Simple, single-domain tasks
- ✅ Know exactly which 1-3 agents needed
- ✅ Standard development workflows

### Direct to `@orchestrate-agents-adv` when:
- ✅ Enterprise-scale coordination needed
- ✅ 4+ agents required
- ✅ Multi-phase, complex workflows
- ✅ Cross-domain integration

## 📊 Performance & Cost Benefits

### Token Efficiency
- **Research Phase**: Sonnet vs Opus = 90% cost reduction
- **Analysis Phase**: Sonnet vs Opus = 90% cost reduction
- **Simple Coordination**: Sonnet vs Opus = 90% cost reduction
- **Complex Coordination**: Opus only when truly needed

### Context Cleanliness
- **Before**: Search artifacts and research noise in coordination context
- **After**: Clean requirements and clear handoffs between layers
- **Benefit**: Better agent performance, reduced context pollution

### Intelligent Resource Usage
- **Sonnet**: Research, analysis, simple coordination (80% of use cases)
- **Opus**: Complex multi-agent orchestration only (20% of use cases)
- **Result**: Optimal cost/performance ratio

## 🚀 Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
- `@orchestrate-agents` (Standard) - Updated for Yellow complexity
