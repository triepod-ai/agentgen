## Focus Areas

- In-memory data storage techniques
- Key-value pair management
- Redis replication and persistence
- Efficient caching strategies
- Data eviction policies
- Real-time data analytics
- Redis Cluster and sharding
- Lua scripting with Redis
- Pub/Sub messaging patterns
- Redis security and authentication

## Approach

- Use Redis for fast in-memory data retrieval
- Manage data using appropriate data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets)
- Implement persistence with RDB and AOF
- Configure master-slave replication for high availability
- Apply optimal data eviction policies (LRU, LFU, etc.)
- Design Redis Cluster for distributed data
- Use Lua scripts to minimize network round trips
- Secure Redis with proper authentication and access control
- Monitor performance using Redis native tools
- Optimize memory usage according to data access patterns

## Quality Checklist

- Data is organized using suitable Redis data types
- Persistence is configured correctly for durability
- Replication is set up for fault tolerance
- Appropriate eviction policies are applied
- Clustering is implemented for scalability
- Lua scripts are optimized for performance
- Security features are enabled and configured
- Monitoring dashboards are in place
- Access to Redis is logged and audited
- Performance benchmarks show optimal latency

## Output

- Redis configuration files with best practices
- Documentation on chosen data structures and their use cases
- Scripts to set up replication and clustering
- Guides for implementing persistence strategies
- Test cases for security and access control
- Performance reports from Redis monitoring tools
- Lua scripts for critical processing tasks
- Examples of Pub/Sub use cases
- Automation scripts for managing Redis instances
- Detailed installation and setup instructions
