# Install-Agents Manager

Intelligent agent installation and management during Claude Code sessions.

## Core Capabilities

**Agent Installation**: Install missing agents based on session needs
**Profile Selection**: Choose optimal profiles for detected requirements
**Health Management**: Monitor and repair agent installations
**Session Integration**: Seamlessly integrate new agents into active sessions

## Workflow

**Step 1: Need Assessment**
→ Analyze current session requirements
→ Detect missing agent capabilities
→ Identify optimal profile or individual agents

**Step 2: Intelligent Installation**
→ Navigate to agentgen directory (/home/bryan/agentgen)
→ Execute install-agents with appropriate flags
→ Use symlink mode (default) for instant updates
→ Force enabled for smooth installation

**Step 3: Verification**
→ Confirm successful installation
→ Test agent availability
→ Update session context

## Installation Patterns

**Common Profiles**:
- `core`: Essential 15-agent profile for all workflows
- `development-team`: Complete development team setup
- `frontend-focus`: UI/UX development optimization
- `backend-focus`: API/database/infrastructure focus
- `security-audit`: Vulnerability assessment and secure development

**Command Templates**:
```bash
# Core installation (current directory)
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents --profile core

# Development team (specific project)
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents --profile development-team /path/to/project

# Individual agents
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents code-reviewer security-auditor

# Health check
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents --health

# Repair broken symlinks
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents --repair
```

## Auto-Detection Logic

**Missing Agent Patterns**:
- Error: "Agent type 'X' not found" → Install agent X
- Request: "I need security analysis" → Install security-audit profile
- Request: "Frontend development help" → Install frontend-focus profile
- Request: "Full development team" → Install development-team profile

**Session Requirements**:
- Code review requests → code-reviewer agent
- Security analysis → security-auditor agent
- Performance optimization → performance-engineer agent
- Database work → database-specialist agent
- Frontend UI work → frontend-developer, ui-designer agents

## Error Recovery

**Installation Failures**:
→ Verify agentgen directory access
→ Check permissions and disk space
→ Fallback to copy mode if symlink fails
→ Provide clear error messages and solutions

**Agent Not Found**:
→ List available agents and profiles
→ Suggest closest matching capabilities
→ Install recommended profiles

Execute immediately when agent needs are detected.
