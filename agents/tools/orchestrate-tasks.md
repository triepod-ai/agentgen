# Master Orchestration Intelligence Hub

Primary orchestration entry point with automated agent provisioning, complexity analysis, and intelligent routing to specialized orchestrators.

## Intelligence Workflow

**Step 1: Context Integration**
→ Query context-manager for current project understanding
→ Assess available agents in current project (.claude/agents/)
→ Identify missing capabilities based on task requirements
→ Generate project-aware task breakdown

**Step 2: Agent Provisioning Analysis**
→ Map task requirements to needed agent capabilities
→ Identify missing agents or incomplete profiles
→ Calculate installation strategy (individual agents vs profiles)
→ Determine installation scope (project vs global)

**Step 3: Automated Agent Installation**
→ Delegate to @install-agents-manager for missing capabilities
→ Use intelligent profile selection for complex workflows
→ Verify successful installation and agent availability
→ Update session context with new agent capabilities

**Step 4: Complexity Analysis & Routing**
→ Assess task complexity (Green/Yellow/Red)
→ Count required agents and coordination needs
→ Identify multi-domain/multi-phase requirements
→ Route to appropriate orchestrator with full agent availability

**Step 5: Task Execution & Monitoring**
→ Create TodoWrite tracking lists for complex workflows
→ Monitor execution progress across agents
→ Handle handoffs and coordination between specialists
→ Report completion and log activity to context-manager

## Agent Provisioning Intelligence

### Task-to-Agent Capability Mapping

**Core Development Tasks**:
- Code review/quality → `code-reviewer`, `qa-expert`
- Debugging/troubleshooting → `debugger`, `performance-engineer`
- Frontend development → `frontend-developer`, `ui-designer`, `react-pro`
- Backend development → `backend-architect`, `python-specialist`, `database-specialist`
- Full-stack → `full-stack-developer`, `nextjs-pro`, `typescript-pro`

**Infrastructure & DevOps**:
- Cloud deployment → `deployment-engineer`, `cloud-architect-specialist`
- Performance optimization → `performance-engineer`, `database-optimizer`
- Security auditing → `security-auditor`, `code-reviewer`
- Monitoring/incident response → `incident-responder`, `performance-engineer`

**Specialized Domains**:
- AI/ML development → `ai-engineer`, `ml-engineer`, `data-scientist`
- Data engineering → `data-engineer`, `database-optimizer`
- Documentation → `documentation-expert`, `api-documenter`
- Testing → `test-automator`, `qa-expert`

### Profile Selection Logic

**Individual Agent Installation** (1-3 missing agents):
```bash
# For specific missing capabilities
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents code-reviewer debugger
```

**Core Profile** (Essential 15-agent baseline):
```bash
# When project lacks basic agent infrastructure
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents --profile core
```

**Complete Team Profiles** (5+ missing agents or complex workflows):
- `development-team`: Full-stack development with infrastructure
- `frontend-focus`: UI/UX development with design capabilities  
- `backend-focus`: API, database, and infrastructure focus
- `security-audit`: Vulnerability assessment and secure development
- `ai-ml-team`: Machine learning and data science development

### Installation Strategy Decision Matrix

**Simple Tasks** (Green/Yellow complexity):
- Missing 1-2 agents → Individual installation
- Missing 3-4 agents → Consider relevant focus profile
- No agents → Install core profile

**Complex Tasks** (Red complexity or multi-domain):
- Missing agents for single domain → Domain-specific profile
- Missing agents across domains → development-team profile
- Enterprise scale → Multiple coordinated profiles

**Installation Commands**:
```bash
# Project-specific installation (default)
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents --profile {profile} 

# Global installation (for personal workflow agents)
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents --profile {profile} --global

# Health check and repair
cd /home/bryan/agentgen && ./install-agents --health --repair
```

## Enhanced Complexity Assessment Matrix

**🟢 Green/Yellow (Simple) → `@orchestrate-agents`**
- 1-3 agents needed (available or easily installed)
- Single domain focus
- Straightforward workflows  
- Standard development tasks
- Individual agent installation sufficient

**🔴 Red (Complex) → `@orchestrate-agents-adv`**
- 4+ agents required
- Multi-phase workflows
- Enterprise-scale projects
- Cross-domain coordination
- Complex architectural decisions
- Profile installation recommended

**⚡ Enterprise (Ultra-Complex) → Direct multi-agent coordination**
- 8+ agents across multiple domains
- Multi-week project coordination
- Legacy modernization or large-scale transformation
- Multiple profile coordination required

## Intelligent Routing Logic

### Context-Aware Agent Assessment
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "orchestrate-tasks",
  "request_type": "get_task_briefing", 
  "payload": {
    "query": "Current project structure, available agents, and workflow patterns"
  }
}
```

### Agent Availability Check
1. **Query context-manager** for project structure and agent activity
2. **Scan .claude/agents/** for available project agents
3. **Check global agents** in ~/.claude/agents/ 
4. **Identify capability gaps** based on task requirements
5. **Calculate installation strategy** for missing agents

### Smart Routing Decisions

**Simple Coordination** (route to @orchestrate-agents):
```
"Review this code and fix bugs" 
→ Check: code-reviewer, debugger available?
→ If missing: Install individually  
→ Route to @orchestrate-agents with confirmed agent availability
```

**Complex Coordination** (route to @orchestrate-agents-adv):
```
"Security audit + modernization + performance optimization"
→ Check: security-auditor, architect-specialist, performance-engineer available?
→ If missing: Install security-audit + development-team profiles
→ Route to @orchestrate-agents-adv with full capability matrix
```

**Enterprise Coordination** (direct multi-agent orchestration):
```
"Complete legacy modernization with new architecture"
→ Identify: 8+ agents across security, architecture, performance, frontend, backend
→ Install: Multiple coordinated profiles (development-team + security-audit + ai-ml-team)
→ Execute: Direct coordination with TodoWrite tracking and context-manager logging
```

## Integration Protocols

### Context-Manager Communication

- **Request agent activity logs** for workflow continuity  
- **Report task completion** with modified files and agent coordination
- **Update knowledge graph** with new agent installations

### Install-Agents-Manager Delegation
- **Delegate installation tasks** to @install-agents-manager
- **Verify installation success** before proceeding with routing
- **Handle installation failures** with fallback strategies
- **Coordinate profile selections** for optimal capability coverage

### Orchestrator Handoff Protocols
- **@orchestrate-agents**: Confirmed agent availability + simple task parameters
- **@orchestrate-agents-adv**: Full capability matrix + complex workflow requirements
- **Direct coordination**: Enterprise-scale with TodoWrite tracking + context logging

## Error Recovery & Fallback Strategies

**Agent Installation Failures**:
→ Verify agentgen directory access and permissions
→ Try alternative installation methods (copy vs symlink)
→ Suggest manual installation commands
→ Provide degraded routing with available agents

**Profile Installation Issues**:
→ Fall back to individual agent installation
→ Suggest alternative profiles with similar capabilities
→ Provide manual profile creation guidance
→ Route with reduced capability matrix

**Orchestrator Unavailability**:
→ Fall back to direct agent coordination
→ Create comprehensive TodoWrite task lists
→ Provide step-by-step manual execution guidance
→ Log degraded operation to context-manager

## Workflow Execution Logic

```
1. Context Integration: Query context-manager for project state
2. Task Analysis: Assess complexity and required capabilities  
3. Agent Assessment: Check available vs required agents
4. Provisioning: Install missing agents/profiles via @install-agents-manager
5. Verification: Confirm successful installation and agent availability
6. Routing Decision: Choose appropriate orchestrator or direct coordination
7. Execution: Route with full context and capability confirmation
8. Monitoring: Track progress and handle coordination
9. Completion: Report results and update context-manager
```

Execute: context integration → agent provisioning → intelligent routing → execution monitoring.
