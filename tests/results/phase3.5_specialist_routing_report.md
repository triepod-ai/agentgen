## ⚡ Technical Implementation

### **Root Cause Analysis** (RESOLVED)
**Problem Identified**: Complexity scoring algorithm systematically undervalued specialist-level tasks
- System Architecture: scored 0.50 → routed to development (wrong)
- Security Audit: scored 0.60 → routed to development (wrong)  
- Legacy Modernization: scored 0.50 → routed to development (wrong)
- ML/AI Pipeline: scored 0.20 → routed to core (wrong)

### **Solution Implemented**: Enhanced Complexity Scoring Algorithm

#### **1. Specialist Domain Recognition (NEW)**
Added 0.5-point bonus for specialist patterns:
```python
specialist_patterns = {
    'architectural': ['microservices', 'event-driven', 'distributed', 'scalability', 'patterns'],
    'security': ['audit', 'compliance', 'vulnerability', 'threat', 'validation'],
    'ml_ai': ['model', 'training', 'pipeline', 'neural', 'deep learning', 'ai'],
    'modernization': ['legacy', 'modernize', 'transformation', 'refactoring', 'cloud']
}
```

#### **2. Compound Complexity Multipliers (NEW)**
Dynamic multipliers for complex specialist tasks:
- Multiple expert domains: **1.5x multiplier**
- Comprehensive + expert domain: **1.3x multiplier**
- Cross-system + expert domain: **1.4x multiplier**

#### **3. Debugging Tier Fix (NEW)**
Explicit rule to ensure debugging tasks score in development tier:
```python
if 'debug' in description_lower and score < 0.4:
    score = 0.5  # Force to development tier minimum
```

### **Algorithm Validation Results**

#### **Before Enhancement:**
- "design microservices architecture with event-driven patterns" → 0.50 → development ❌
- "conduct comprehensive security audit with compliance validation" → 0.60 → development ❌
- "modernize legacy system architecture with cloud migration" → 0.50 → development ❌
- "implement machine learning model training pipeline" → 0.20 → core ❌

#### **After Enhancement:**
- "design microservices architecture with event-driven patterns" → 1.00 → specialists ✅
- "conduct comprehensive security audit with compliance validation" → 1.00 → specialists ✅
- "modernize legacy system architecture with cloud migration" → 1.00 → specialists ✅
- "implement machine learning model training pipeline" → 0.70 → specialists ✅
