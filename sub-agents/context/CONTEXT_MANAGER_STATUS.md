# Context Manager Operational Status

## ✅ Successfully Activated and Bootstrapped

**Date**: 2025-08-14T12:08:08Z  
**Project**: agentgen - Central AI Agent Management Hub

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Bootstrap Initialization (Path A)
- ✅ Created `sub-agents/context/` directory structure
- ✅ Generated initial project knowledge graph
- ✅ Scanned entire project directory tree
- ✅ Inferred purpose for each directory based on contents
- ✅ Created comprehensive `context-manager.json` (317 lines)

### 2. Knowledge Graph Structure
The context-manager has successfully mapped:
- **14 root-level directories** with detailed purposes
- **14 agent category directories** containing 60+ agent definitions
- **All project files** including installers, documentation, and configurations
- **Nested subdirectories** with complete file listings

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Project Structure Mapping
- Complete filesystem audit of `/home/bryan/agentgen`
- Intelligent purpose inference for all directories
- Timestamped scanning for change detection
- Exclusion of common non-relevant paths (.git, node_modules, __pycache__)

#### Communication Protocol
- JSON-based request/response format established
- Three query types supported:
  - `get_file_location` - Find specific files
  - `get_directory_purpose` - Understand folder roles
  - `get_task_briefing` - Get comprehensive task context

#### Activity Logging
- Agent activity tracking system initialized
- First entry logged: context-manager bootstrap operation
- Atomic updates to maintain data integrity

### 4. Verification Tests Passed

✅ **File Location Query**: Successfully found `python-specialist.md`
✅ **Directory Purpose Query**: Retrieved purpose of `/agents/specialists/`
✅ **Task Briefing Query**: Generated comprehensive project briefing
✅ **Activity Logging**: Recorded context-manager's bootstrap action

## Project Insights from Knowledge Graph

### Agent Repository Structure
- **60+ agents** organized across 14 categories
- **Complexity tiers**: Templates organized as green/yellow/red
- **Specialist agents**: 12 domain experts in `/agents/specialists/`
- **Symlink hub**: Central distribution system for all projects

### Key Directories
1. `/agents/` - Main agent repository (14 subcategories)
2. `/templates/` - Agent templates by complexity level
3. `/profiles/` - Deployment configuration profiles
4. `/sub-agents/context/` - Context management storage
5. `/deprecated/` - Legacy agents for migration support

## How Other Agents Can Use Context Manager

### Query Examples

```json
// Find a specific file
{
  "requesting_agent": "your-agent-name",
  "request_type": "get_file_location",
  "payload": {
    "query": "filename-to-find"
  }
}

// Get directory purpose
{
  "requesting_agent": "your-agent-name",
  "request_type": "get_directory_purpose",
  "payload": {
    "query": "/path/to/directory"
  }
}

// Get task briefing
{
  "requesting_agent": "your-agent-name",
  "request_type": "get_task_briefing",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Description of what you need to do"
  }
}
```

### Activity Reporting

After completing work, agents should report:

```json
{
  "reporting_agent": "your-agent-name",
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "Brief description of completed work",
  "files_modified": [
    "/path/to/modified/file1.py",
    "/path/to/modified/file2.md"
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Agent Integration**: Other agents should start querying context-manager for project information
2. **Incremental Updates**: Context-manager will run Path B (sync) on subsequent invocations
3. **Activity Tracking**: All agents should report their activities for audit trail
4. **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Use context-manager as central nervous system for collaboration

## Technical Details

- **Context File**: `/home/bryan/agentgen/sub-agents/context/context-manager.json`
- **File Size**: ~15KB (well-structured JSON)
- **Last Scan**: 2025-08-14T12:08:08Z
- **Agent Location**: `/home/bryan/agentgen/agents/specialists/context-manager.md`
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Operational

The context-manager is now the active "central nervous system" for the agentgen project, ready to facilitate intelligent collaboration between all agents through its comprehensive project knowledge graph.
