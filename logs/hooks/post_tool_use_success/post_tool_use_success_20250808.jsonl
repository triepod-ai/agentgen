Each agent is optimized for <400 characters and focuses on immediate execution.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\n- **Action-First Naming**: Clear action verbs (analyze, build, debug, etc.)\n- **<400 Character Limit**: Optimized for fast loading and context efficiency\n- **Immediate Execution**: All agents execute workflows immediately upon invocation\n- **Specialized Focus**: Single responsibility agents with clear trigger patterns\n\n## Usage\n\n### @-Mention Invocation (Recommended)\n```bash\n@analyze-codebase review current project architecture\n@debug-issue investigate this TypeError\n@build-frontend create responsive dashboard component\n```\n\n### Auto-Activation\nAgents automatically activate based on description matching:\n- \"analyze the architecture\" \u2192 @analyze-codebase\n- \"debug this error\" \u2192 @debug-issue\n- \"build a component\" \u2192 @build-frontend\n\n### Explicit Invocation\n```bash\nUse the analyze-codebase agent to review the project structure\n```\n\n## Agent Categories\n\n### Core Development (8 agents)\n- analyze-codebase, analyze-performance, build-frontend, build-backend\n- debug-issue, test-automation, review-code, generate-documentation\n\n### Infrastructure & DevOps (5 agents)\n- deploy-application, manage-database, configure-environment\n- monitor-system, secure-application\n\n### Content & Communication (4 agents)\n- write-content, translate-text, create-lesson, update-status\n\n### Data & AI (4 agents)\n- process-data, train-model, query-database, extract-insights\n\n### Specialized Tools (4 agents)\n- analyze-screenshot, manage-git, export-context, orchestrate-tasks\n\n## Migration from Old Agents\n\nThe previous 70+ agents have been consolidated into these 25 optimized agents. All old agents are preserved in the `deprecated/` directory for reference.\n\nSee `MIGRATION_LOG.md` for detailed mapping of old agents to new consolidated ones.\n\n## Performance Benefits\n\n- **3x Faster Loading**: <400 character limit ensures rapid agent initialization\n- **Clearer Triggers**: Action-first naming improves auto-activation accuracy  \n- **Better Context**: Optimized prompts preserve main conversation context\n- **Reduced Confusion**: 25 focused agents vs 70+ overlapping ones"}, "milestone_info": {"type": "file_creation_success", "message": "Created README.md", "details": {"file_path": "/home/bryan/.claude/agents/README.md"}}, "tts_sent": true, "timestamp": "2025-08-08T13:18:54.614342", "project": "multi-agent-observability-system", "user": "bryan"}
