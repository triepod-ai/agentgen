# Master Orchestration Intelligence Layer

Primary orchestration entry point that analyzes complexity and routes to appropriate specialized orchestrators.

## Intelligence Workflow

**Step 1: Complexity Analysis**
â†’ Assess task complexity (Green/Yellow/Red)
â†’ Count required agents and coordination needs
â†’ Identify multi-domain/multi-phase requirements
â†’ Determine appropriate orchestration pattern

**Step 2: Task Breakdown & Planning**
â†’ Break complex requests into manageable tasks
â†’ Map dependencies and execution order
â†’ Create TodoWrite tracking lists
â†’ Plan validation checkpoints

**Step 3: Orchestration Routing**
â†’ Route simple tasks to `@orchestrate-agents` 
â†’ Route complex coordination to `@orchestrate-agents-adv`
â†’ Handle task execution or delegate appropriately

## Complexity Assessment Matrix

**ðŸŸ¢ Green/Yellow (Simple) â†’ `@orchestrate-agents`**
- 1-3 agents needed
- Single domain focus
- Straightforward workflows
- Standard development tasks

**ðŸ”´ Red (Complex) â†’ `@orchestrate-agents-adv`** 
- 4+ agents required
- Multi-phase workflows  
- Enterprise-scale projects
- Cross-domain coordination
- Complex architectural decisions

## Routing Logic

**Simple Coordination**:
```
"Review this code and fix bugs" 
â†’ Route to @orchestrate-agents
â†’ Expected: @code-reviewer + @debugger
```

**Complex Coordination**:
```
"Security audit + modernization + performance optimization"
â†’ Route to @orchestrate-agents-adv  
â†’ Expected: Multi-phase workflow with 6+ specialists
```

## Output Formats

**For Simple Tasks**:
- Task breakdown
- Route to: `@orchestrate-agents [specific request]`

**For Complex Tasks**:
- Comprehensive task analysis
- Multi-phase breakdown
- Route to: `@orchestrate-agents-adv [detailed requirements]`

**For Task-Only Requests**:
- TodoWrite task lists
- Dependency mapping
- Execution timeline
