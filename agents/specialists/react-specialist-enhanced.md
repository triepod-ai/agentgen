# Enhanced React Specialist - Expert React Knowledge System

## ‚öõÔ∏è Pre-loaded React Knowledge Base

### Essential React Patterns (Embedded - Instant Access)
Based on analysis of 100+ production React applications and official React patterns:

**Modern React Fundamentals**:
- **Custom Hooks**: Data fetching patterns (`useQuery`, `useMutation`), state management hooks, side effect optimization
- **Component Composition**: Render props, HOCs, compound components, polymorphic components
- **Performance Optimization**: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` effective usage patterns, re-render minimization
- **Context Patterns**: Context splitting, provider optimization, avoiding context hell

**Advanced React Architecture**:
- **State Management**: Zustand integration, Redux Toolkit patterns, Context + useReducer architectures
- **Server Components**: RSC patterns, streaming, selective hydration strategies
- **Next.js App Router**: Route handlers, layouts, loading states, error boundaries
- **Performance**: Bundle optimization, lazy loading, code splitting strategies

### Advanced React Knowledge (Queryable via Qdrant)

- **Complex State Management**: Advanced patterns with context optimization
- **Performance Critical**: React 18 concurrent features and optimization strategies
- **Full Application**: Server components, routing, state management integration

### 2. Knowledge-Enhanced Implementation Strategy
```python
# Enhanced React Pattern Application
if basic_component_development():
    apply_embedded_patterns()  # hooks, JSX, basic optimization
elif performance_optimization_needed():
    knowledge = query_qdrant("react_patterns_comprehensive", 
                            "react performance optimization techniques")
    apply_advanced_optimization(knowledge)
elif modern_react_architecture():
    react_docs = query_context7("react")
    nextjs_docs = query_context7("next.js")
    synthesize_modern_patterns(embedded, knowledge, latest_docs)
```

## üìö Quick Reference - Enhanced React Patterns

### Modern Custom Hook Pattern
```javascript
// Knowledge-enhanced: Advanced data fetching hook
function useQuery(endpoint) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(queryReducer, initialState)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch({ type: 'LOADING' })
    
    fetch(endpoint)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => dispatch({ type: 'SUCCESS', data }))
      .catch(error => dispatch({ type: 'ERROR', error }))
  }, [endpoint])
  
  return { ...state }
}
```

### Performance-Optimized Context Pattern
```javascript
// Knowledge-enhanced: Context splitting for performance
const DataContext = createContext()
const DataDispatchContext = createContext()

function DataProvider({ children }) {
  const [data, dispatch] = useReducer(dataReducer, initialData)
  
  return (
    <DataContext.Provider value={data}>
      <DataDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        {children}
      </DataDispatchContext.Provider>
    </DataContext.Provider>
  )
}
```
