## ‚ö° 5-Step Quick Start (Under 5 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
```bash
cd /home/bryan/agentgen
# System automatically handles Windows‚ÜíWSL path conversion
```

### **Step 2: Choose Your Strategic Profile**
```bash
# For strategic leadership
./install-agents --symlink --profile enterprise-leadership /path/to/project

# For modern web development  
./install-agents --symlink --profile modern-web-stack /path/to/project

# For startup MVP development
./install-agents --symlink --profile startup-mvp /path/to/project
```

### **Step 3: Start Orchestration**
```bash
# Primary entry point for complex tasks
@orchestrate-tasks "build authentication system with security audit"

# Direct specialist invocation  
@react-specialist "optimize component performance"
@security-auditor "audit application vulnerabilities"
```

### **Step 4: Leverage Auto-Activation**
Simply describe your task naturally - agents activate automatically:
- "Review this code for security issues" ‚Üí security-auditor activates
- "Create responsive navigation component" ‚Üí ui-designer + react-specialist
- "Debug this authentication error" ‚Üí debugger + security-auditor

### **Step 5: Monitor & Maintain**
```bash
./install-agents --symlink --health    # Check system status
./install-agents --symlink --repair    # Fix any issues
```
