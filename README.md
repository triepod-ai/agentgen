  - Enterprise platform development (frontend + backend + DevOps + security)
  - Complex data pipeline (data engineering + ML + infrastructure + monitoring)

Orchestration Strategy:
  1. @orchestrate-tasks: Intelligent routing and single-agent optimization
  2. @orchestrate-agents: 1-3 agent coordination with handoff management  
  3. @orchestrate-agents-adv: Enterprise-scale workflows with quality gates
```

#### Decision Framework for Pattern Selection
```yaml
Step 1: Complexity Assessment
  Simple (0-30%): → Single Green agent (@analyze-screenshot, @update-status)
  Standard (30-70%): → Single Yellow agent (@react-pro, @build-backend)
  Complex (70-90%): → Single Red agent (@architect-specialist, @security-auditor)
  Enterprise (90-100%): → Multi-agent via @orchestrate-agents-adv

Step 2: Domain Analysis
  Single Domain: → Specialist agent (e.g., @python-specialist for Python tasks)
  Cross-Domain: → Orchestration (@orchestrate-tasks for intelligent routing)
  Multi-Domain: → Multi-agent coordination (@orchestrate-agents or @orchestrate-agents-adv)

Step 3: Scale Considerations
  Individual Features: → Direct agent invocation
  Project Components: → @orchestrate-tasks coordination
  System-Wide Changes: → @orchestrate-agents-adv enterprise workflows
```
