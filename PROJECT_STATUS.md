# Agent System Status

## Recent Session: Agent System Consolidation and Complexity Implementation

### Major Accomplishments:
1. **Agent Consolidation**: Successfully reduced agent count from 74 to 31 agents (58% reduction)
   - 25 general-purpose agents with action-first naming
   - 6 specialist agents for deep expertise
   - All original agents preserved in backup

2. **Complexity-Based Model System**: Implemented 3-tier complexity system
   - Green (Easy) - Haiku model: 9 agents for simple tasks
   - Yellow (Medium) - Sonnet model: 15 agents for standard development
   - Red (Hard) - Opus model: 7 agents for complex analysis
   - Each agent now has model and color fields for intelligent routing

3. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - All agents optimized to <400 characters for fast loading
   - Right model for right task (cost and performance optimization)
   - Maintained robustness through specialist agents

4. **Tool Updates**: Updated all Sequential MCP references to use Chroma sequential thinking tool
   - Updated architect-specialist.md
   - Updated security-specialist.md  
   - Updated ml-specialist.md

### Files Created/Modified:
- Created COMPLEXITY_SYSTEM.md documenting the tier system
- Created COMPLEXITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md with implementation summary
- Updated README.md with complexity documentation
- Created 6 new specialist agents
- Updated all 25 general agents with model/color fields
- Created update_complexity.sh script for bulk updates

### Current State:
- Agent system fully operational with complexity-based routing
- Clear action-first naming convention implemented
- Balance achieved between simplicity and robustness
- Ready for production use with optimized performance

### Next Steps:
- Conduct comprehensive testing of complexity-based routing
- Finalize documentation for new agent system
- Create performance benchmarks
- Prepare for initial production deployment
