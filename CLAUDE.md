## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

Based on enterprise research, our agent system supports:

### Single-Agent Patterns
- **Reactive**: Basic input ‚Üí processing ‚Üí output (Green agents)
- **Memory-Augmented**: Context-aware processing (Yellow agents)
- **Tool-Using**: MCP integration for external APIs (All tiers)
- **Planning**: Multi-step workflow orchestration (Yellow/Red)
- **Reflection**: Self-improving with feedback loops (Red specialists)

### Multi-Agent Patterns
- **Sequential**: Linear pipeline processing
- **Concurrent**: Parallel processing with aggregation
- **Hierarchical**: Supervisor agents coordinating sub-agents
- **Handoff**: Dynamic delegation between specialists
- **Competitive**: Multiple agents, best result selected

## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### 0. Setup with Symlinks (NEW - Recommended)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Must run from agentgen directory**
The `install-agents` script must be run from `/home/bryan/agentgen/` directory as it needs access to the agents hub and configuration files.

```bash
# Navigate to agentgen first
cd /home/bryan/agentgen

# UNIFIED INSTALLER with symlinks (recommended)
./install-agents --symlink --global --profile core
./install-agents --symlink --project /path/to/target --profile development

# NEW: Strategic team-composition profiles (Phase 1) - Both modes work perfectly
./install-agents --symlink --project /path/to/target --profile enterprise-leadership  # 9 strategic decision-makers
./install-agents --copy --project /path/to/target --profile startup-mvp              # 11 lean rapid development (copy mode)
./install-agents --symlink --project /path/to/target --profile modern-web-stack     # 12 TypeScript/React specialists

# Copy mode installation (traditional)
./install-agents --profile development-team /path/to/target

# Maintenance (symlink mode)
./install-agents --symlink --health
./install-agents --symlink --repair

# Migrate existing installations to symlinks
./migrate-to-symlinks.sh /path/to/target

# Legacy symlink-only installer (still available)
./install-agents-symlink --project /path/to/target --profile development
```

**Common Mistake:**
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong - redundant command name
install-agents install-agents --profile development-team

# ‚úÖ Correct - run from agentgen directory
cd /home/bryan/agentgen
./install-agents --profile development-team /path/to/target
```

### 1. Setup with UV (Alternative)
```bash
# Navigate to agentgen first
cd /home/bryan/agentgen

# Modern Python interface with UV (10-100x faster)
./uv-wrapper.py setup --dev
agentgen install /path/to/project --all

# Traditional shell interface (still supported)
./install-agents --all /path/to/project
```

### 2. Choose the Right Agent
```bash
# Simple tasks (Green complexity)
@analyze-screenshot extract-data-from-ui
@update-status current-progress

# Standard development (Yellow complexity)
@debug-issue investigate-TypeError
@build-backend create-user-api

# Complex reasoning (Red complexity)
@analyze-performance optimize-system-bottlenecks
@security-auditor audit-vulnerabilities
```

### 3. Leverage Orchestration (Context-Manager Integrated)
```bash
# Primary orchestration entry point (RECOMMENDED)
@orchestrate-tasks "comprehensive code review and security audit"
@orchestrate-tasks "build authentication system with testing"

# Direct orchestration (for specific coordination needs)
@orchestrate-agents "review code quality and fix bugs"  # 1-3 agents
@orchestrate-agents-adv "enterprise security audit with modernization"  # 4+ agents

# Traditional single-agent workflows
analyze-codebase ‚Üí review-code ‚Üí deploy-application
```

### 4. Strategic Profile Selection (NEW)
Choose team composition based on organizational context:

```bash
# Enterprise Leadership (9 agents) - Strategic decision-makers
# Both modes work perfectly
./install-agents --symlink --profile enterprise-leadership
./install-agents --copy --profile enterprise-leadership
# Best for: C-level decisions, strategic planning, enterprise architecture
# Key agents: architect-specialist, product-manager, security-auditor, performance-engineer

# Startup MVP (11 agents) - Lean rapid development  
# Both modes work perfectly
./install-agents --symlink --profile startup-mvp
./install-agents --copy --profile startup-mvp
# Best for: Fast prototyping, resource constraints, MVP validation
# Key agents: full-stack-developer, build-frontend, build-backend, debugger

# Modern Web Stack (12 agents) - TypeScript/React specialists
# Both modes work perfectly
./install-agents --symlink --profile modern-web-stack
./install-agents --copy --profile modern-web-stack
# Best for: Modern web applications, React/TypeScript focus, UI/UX excellence
# Key agents: react-specialist, nextjs-pro, ui-designer, frontend-developer
```

**Decision Matrix:**
- **Budget/Timeline**: enterprise-leadership ‚Üí startup-mvp ‚Üí modern-web-stack
- **Team Size**: enterprise-leadership (large) ‚Üí modern-web-stack (medium) ‚Üí startup-mvp (small)
- **Technical Focus**: modern-web-stack (frontend) ‚Üí startup-mvp (full-stack) ‚Üí enterprise-leadership (architecture)

### 5. Follow Best Practices
- Start with single-agent patterns before multi-agent complexity
- Match complexity tier to task requirements
- Use <400 character agent descriptions for optimal performance
- Leverage MCP protocol for external service integration
- **Strategic Shift**: Team-composition-based profiles align with real-world team structures and enterprise patterns

- **ui-designer** (development): Specialized agent for domain-specific tasks
- **ux-designer** (development): Specialized agent for domain-specific tasks

### Usage Instructions

These agents can be invoked in three ways:

1. **Automatic Invocation**: Claude Code will automatically select the appropriate agent based on your task
2. **Explicit Invocation**: Use phrases like "Use the ux-designer to..." or "Have ux-designer handle this"
3. **Agent Organizer**: For complex multi-agent workflows, the agent-organizer can coordinate multiple specialists

### Examples

```bash
# Direct invocation
"Use the code-reviewer to analyze this pull request"
"Have the security-auditor scan for vulnerabilities"

# Multi-agent coordination
"Use backend-architect to design the API, then have security-auditor review it"
```

### Agent Categories

- **business**: Product management and business analysis
- **data-ai**: Data engineering, AI/ML, and database optimization
- **development**: Frontend, backend, and full-stack development
- **infrastructure**: Cloud, DevOps, and performance engineering
- **quality-testing**: Code review, QA, and testing automation
- **security**: Security auditing and vulnerability assessment
- **specialization**: API documentation and specialized expertise

### Best Practices

- **Start with @orchestrate-tasks** for complex, multi-step operations
- Trust automatic delegation for optimal agent selection
- All orchestration agents automatically integrate with context-manager for project awareness
- Use explicit invocation when you need specific expertise
- Context-manager eliminates need to re-explain project structure
- For enterprise coordination, @orchestrate-tasks will route to appropriate orchestrator
