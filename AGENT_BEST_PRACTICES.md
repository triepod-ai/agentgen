# Agent Best Practices - Enterprise Guidelines

Based on research from Microsoft Azure Architecture Center, Speakeasy, and Databricks enterprise implementations.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each agent should have one clear, focused purpose
- Avoid agents that try to handle multiple unrelated domains
- Example: `debug-issue` focuses solely on debugging, not deployment or testing

### 2. **Complexity-Appropriate Architecture**
```yaml
Simple Tasks (Green):
  - Reactive patterns
  - Direct input → output
  - Minimal context requirements
  - Examples: File operations, status updates

Moderate Tasks (Yellow):
  - Memory-augmented patterns
  - Multi-step workflows
  - Tool integration
  - Examples: Code review, API development

Complex Tasks (Red):
  - Planning and reflection patterns
  - Multi-agent coordination
  - Advanced reasoning
  - Examples: Architecture design, security auditing
```

### 3. **Deterministic vs Dynamic Routing**
- **Deterministic**: Hard-coded chains for predictable workflows
- **Dynamic**: Agent-driven routing for complex, unpredictable tasks
- Choose based on workflow variability and requirements

## Architecture Pattern Selection

### When to Use Single-Agent Systems
✅ **Use when:**
- Tasks are within a cohesive domain
- Workflow is moderately complex but manageable by one agent
- You need flexibility without multi-agent overhead
- Good default choice for most enterprise use cases

❌ **Avoid when:**
- Tasks span radically different domains
- Need specialized conversation contexts
- Tool set is too large for one agent to manage effectively

### When to Use Multi-Agent Systems
✅ **Use when:**
- Distinct problem areas require specialized expertise
- Each agent needs unique conversation history or prompts
- Tool sets are domain-specific and large
- Need reflection, critique, or collaboration patterns

❌ **Avoid when:**
- Single agent can handle the complexity
- Overhead of coordination exceeds benefits
- Debugging across multiple agents is impractical

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Best Practices

#### Prompt Engineering
```yaml
Clear Instructions:
  - Keep prompts minimal and focused
  - Avoid contradictory or competing instructions
  - Provide only necessary context and tools

Tool Selection:
  - Grant only essential tools for security
  - Use MCP protocol for external API standardization
  - Implement proper error handling and timeouts
```

#### Error Handling & Reliability
```yaml
Timeout & Retry:
  - Implement exponential backoff
  - Set reasonable timeout limits
  - Include circuit breaker patterns

Graceful Degradation:
  - Plan for tool/LLM failures
  - Provide fallback logic
  - Maintain service continuity

State Management:
  - Avoid shared mutable state in concurrent agents
  - Use proper synchronization mechanisms
  - Implement checkpoints for recovery
```

#### Security Considerations
```yaml
Least Privilege:
  - Grant minimal required permissions
  - Sandbox code execution environments
  - Implement human approval gates for sensitive actions

Authentication:
  - Secure agent-to-agent communication
  - Implement proper identity propagation
  - Follow data privacy regulations

Audit Trails:
  - Log all agent decisions and actions
  - Maintain compliance documentation
  - Enable troubleshooting and analysis
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Latency Management
```yaml
Model Selection:
  - Use appropriate complexity tier (Green/Yellow/Red)
  - Cache repeated queries and results
  - Minimize unnecessary LLM calls

Parallel Processing:
  - Use concurrent patterns when possible
  - Implement proper resource limits
  - Avoid bottlenecks in coordination

Context Optimization:
  - Keep agent descriptions under 400 characters
  - Minimize context window usage
  - Use summarization for long histories
```

#### Cost Optimization
```yaml
Tiered Usage:
  - Green agents for simple tasks (lowest cost)
  - Yellow agents for standard workflows (balanced)
  - Red agents only for complex reasoning (highest capability)

Efficient Orchestration:
  - Combine steps where possible
  - Use deterministic chains for predictable flows
  - Cache results to avoid redundant processing
```

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Strategies
```yaml
Unit Testing:
  - Test individual agent behaviors
  - Validate tool calling mechanisms
  - Verify error handling paths

Integration Testing:
  - Test multi-agent workflows
  - Validate handoff mechanisms
  - Check end-to-end performance

Regression Testing:
  - Pin LLM versions for consistency
  - Test against changing model behaviors
  - Validate performance over time
```

### Observability Requirements
```yaml
Instrumentation:
  - Log all agent operations and decisions
  - Track performance and resource usage
  - Monitor success/failure rates

Troubleshooting:
  - Implement distributed tracing
  - Provide clear error messages
  - Enable replay and debugging capabilities
```

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Over-Engineering
- Using complex patterns when simple ones suffice
- Creating agents without meaningful specialization
- Ignoring latency impacts of multi-hop communication

### ❌ Under-Engineering  
- Single agents handling too many domains
- Insufficient error handling and recovery
- Lack of proper monitoring and observability

### ❌ Resource Management Issues
- Ignoring token consumption and costs
- Creating infinite loops or retry cycles
- Shared mutable state causing race conditions

### ❌ Security Oversights
- Overprivileged agents with unnecessary permissions
- Insufficient input validation and sanitization
- Inadequate audit trails and compliance tracking

## Decision Framework

Use this framework to choose the right architecture pattern:

```yaml
Start Here:
  Question: "Can a single agent handle this workflow effectively?"
  Yes: → Single-Agent System
  No: → Continue

Complexity Check:
  Question: "Do you have clearly distinct domains or specialized expertise needs?"
  Yes: → Multi-Agent System
  No: → Single-Agent with Tool Integration

Pattern Selection:
  Simple & Predictable: → Deterministic Chain
  Dynamic but Manageable: → Single-Agent with Planning
  Multiple Domains: → Multi-Agent Supervisor Pattern
  Complex Collaboration: → Multi-Agent Group Chat or Hierarchical
  Open-Ended Problems: → Multi-Agent Magentic Pattern
```

This framework provides practical guidance for building robust, scalable, and maintainable agent systems based on proven enterprise patterns and best practices.
