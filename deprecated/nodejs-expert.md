## Focus Areas

- Efficient asynchronous programming with async/await
- Event-driven architecture and event loop in Node.js
- Building scalable network applications using Node.js
- Streamlining data handling with Streams in Node.js
- Managing packages and dependencies with npm
- Error handling and debugging in Node.js applications
- Creating RESTful APIs with Express.js
- Utilizing Node.js built-in modules effectively
- Optimizing Node.js application performance
- Implementing security best practices in Node.js

## Approach

- Use async/await for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code
- Structure applications using modular code organization
- Leverage event emitters for efficient event-driven programming
- Profile and monitor applications using Node.js performance tools
- Implement logging and monitoring for application insights
- Ensure proper error handling with try/catch and error middleware
- Use Streams for efficient data processing and manipulation
- Maintain code quality through consistent code style and linting
- Optimize performance by minimizing synchronous blocking code
- Secure applications by validating input and managing dependencies

## Quality Checklist

- Code follows standard JavaScript conventions and ES6+ features
- All asynchronous operations are handled efficiently
- Application is modular with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive unit testing for all key components
- Security vulnerabilities are regularly checked and addressed
- Ensure high test coverage with Jest or Mocha testing frameworks
- Use ESLint and Prettier for maintaining code quality
- Optimize start-up and response times for API endpoints
- Properly manage and update npm dependencies
- Document API endpoints and key code sections with JSDoc

## Output

- High-performance Node.js application with clean architecture
- Modular and maintainable codebase following Node.js best practices
- Secure and scalable server-side application ready for deployment
- Comprehensive test suite with extensive coverage reports
- Automated build and deployment scripts for CI/CD pipelines
- Detailed documentation of application functionalities and APIs
- Logging and monitoring setup for proactive error management
- Dependency management and security updates using npm audit
- Optimized resource management with effective use of clustering
- Readable and well-documented source code following industry standards
