## Narrative

As a software developer working on a complex microservices project, I need to create several specialized agents to automate repetitive tasks like code review, deployment validation, and performance monitoring. Instead of spending hours researching agent configuration syntax and best practices, I invoke the Agent Builder Agent with a simple `@agent-builder-agent` mention. The agent immediately begins an interactive interview, asking about my specific needs, the types of files I work with, and the workflows I want to automate. Based on my responses, it generates optimized agent configurations that follow the 400-character performance guidelines, selects appropriate tool permissions, and creates descriptive activation patterns. Within minutes, I have production-ready agents deployed and integrated into my workflow, complete with documentation and usage guidance. The Agent Builder Agent has transformed what used to be a complex, error-prone manual process into a streamlined, quality-assured experience that lets me focus on my core development work rather than agent configuration minutiae.
