## Session Export - Wed Sep 24 01:47:15 PM CDT 2025
**Session Summary**: Agent development session focused on creating and enhancing the `general-research-assistant` specialized agent with Ollama MCP integration. Successfully created a multi-model research agent leveraging local AI models (qwen2.5-coder, llama3.2:1b, dolphin-mistral, qwen3:8b-q4_K_M, gpt-oss:20b) for comprehensive research analysis. Enhanced the agent with structured file output system organizing results in `research/` directory with timestamp-based naming convention.

**Key Activities**:
- Created new `general-research-assistant` agent in `/agents/specialists/` directory
- Integrated Ollama MCP tools for multi-model analysis capabilities
- Added comprehensive model usage patterns for 5 different AI models
- Implemented structured file output system with `research/` directory organization
- Enhanced workflow with individual model file outputs and synthesis reporting
- Configured agent with purple color coding and advanced capabilities
- Designed fallback strategies for model availability scenarios

**Working Directory**: /home/bryan/agentgen
**Tools Used**: Write tool (agent creation), Edit tool (enhancements), Ollama MCP integration
**Status**: ✅ Specialized multi-model research agent successfully created and configured

## Session Export - Thu Sep 25 2025 (Bash Completion Setup)
**Session Summary**: Successfully set up and enhanced bash autocompletion for the install-agents command. Updated completion script with missing options, optimized agent name discovery for improved performance, and validated all completion functionality. The completion system now provides intelligent context-aware suggestions for 23 command options, 13 profiles, and 106 agents across all categories.

**Key Activities**:
- Reviewed existing bash completion infrastructure (install-agents-completion.bash)
- Added missing --list-installed option to completion script
- Optimized agent name discovery using category-based listing instead of find command for faster performance
- Created comprehensive validation test script (test-completion-validation.sh)
- Debugged and resolved completion issues with empty word handling
- Verified completion registration in ~/.bashrc for persistence across sessions
- Tested all completion scenarios: options, profiles, agents, and directory paths
- Created debug tooling for troubleshooting completion behavior

**Working Directory**: /home/bryan/agentgen
**Tools Used**: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, TodoWrite (task tracking)
**Status**: ✅ Bash completion fully functional with optimized performance and 106 agent completions

## Session Export - Thu Jan 30 10:11:35 AM CST 2025
**Session Summary**: Enhanced agent profiles and documentation for Ollama-based local LLM research capabilities. Added two new specialist agents (general-research-assistant and ollama-specialist-enhanced) to ai-ml-team and development-team profiles. Updated agent prompt files with clear "When to Use" sections to differentiate between research-focused multi-model analysis versus Ollama operations management. Improved agent discoverability and user guidance.

**Key Activities**:
- Added general-research-assistant and ollama-specialist-enhanced to ai-ml-team profile
- Added general-research-assistant to development-team profile with clarifying comments
- Updated both agent prompt files with explicit "When to Use This Agent" sections
- Clarified distinction: general-research-assistant for multi-perspective research reports vs ollama-specialist-enhanced for Ollama operations
- Added specific usage examples and anti-patterns for each agent
- Enhanced profile comments to indicate local LLM research capabilities via Ollama

**Working Directory**: /home/bryan/agentgen
**Tools Used**: Read, Edit, Grep, Bash, TodoWrite
**Status**: ✅ Agent profiles updated with new Ollama specialist agents and clear usage guidance

## Session Export - Thu Sep 26 08:07:42 AM  2025
**Session Summary**: Session stop hook enhancement session converting /agent-timeline-updater slash command into automated timeline functionality. Successfully integrated timeline updating capabilities into the dashboard session stop hook, enabling automatic PROJECT_STATUS.md updates when Claude Code sessions end. Implemented comprehensive testing suite validating all functionality including file creation, entry appending, and error handling scenarios.

**Key Activities**:
- Analyzed existing dashboard session stop hook architecture (/home/bryan/dashboard/.claude/hooks/stop.py)
- Created update_project_status_timeline() function based on slash command logic
- Integrated timeline updater into main session stop workflow with detailed summaries
- Enhanced session data analysis to include tools used, files modified, and commands run
- Added timeline update status to event tracking and observability system
- Developed comprehensive test suite (test_timeline_hook.py) with 100% pass rate
- Validated file creation, entry appending, error handling, and session integration scenarios

**Working Directory**: /home/bryan/agentgen
**Tools Used**: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, TodoWrite, Python testing
**Status**: ✅ Session stop hook successfully enhanced with automated timeline updating functionality
