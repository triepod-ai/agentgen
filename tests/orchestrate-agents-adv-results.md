## Differentiation from Simple Agent

The advanced agent demonstrated clear differentiation from the simple `@orchestrate-agents`:

| Aspect | Simple Agent | Advanced Agent |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Complexity Handling** | Green/Yellow focus | Red complexity specialization |
| **Pattern Types** | Single-agent selection | Multi-agent orchestration |
| **Coordination Depth** | Basic recommendations | Full workflow orchestration |
| **Alternative Options** | Limited | Multiple approaches with trade-offs |
| **Resource Planning** | Not provided | Detailed time estimates and phases |
| **Quality Integration** | Basic | Comprehensive validation gates |

## Areas of Excellence

### 1. **Enterprise-Scale Thinking**
- All responses showed understanding of enterprise constraints
